Open source MIDI music by Fredrik Johansson (http://fredrikj.net).

This repository contains a small fraction of the >1800 MIDI files I've made since 1999 (more will be added when I find the time). It also contains SynthFont arrangement files for playback with the SGM-V2.01 soundfont. Links to MP3 renditions will be added at a later time.
